# Basilisk
The public release of Basilisk, the ultimate FE1 editing suite!

You can use this change units, maps, items, text, and more in the first Fire Emblem game!

Also included are various mods that don't exist in the original, plus a few graphical tweaks,
to ensure your hack will have the nicest experience!

More editors should come soon, but you can try using ThingMaker in the meantime to make units for players/enemies (requires knowledge of Python).

See the readme in the .ZIP for more information on how to use.

If you like this, be sure to support my indie game, Octo Vinctum, on Steam!
