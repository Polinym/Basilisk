The Mamkutes of

tribes.>
[NEXT]
@The divine Narga,
the magic Basilisk,
and fiery Salamander.>
[NEXT]
@The superior Narga clan
stopped the others from
conquering mankind.>
[NEXT]
@They could seal their
true dragon forms in
stones and take a
human form.>

@They lived in peace
with humanity, until
Mediuth of the Earth
Dragon clan appeared.>
[NEXT]
@With his great power, he
overthrew the Narga and
established the country
of Durhua.>
[NEXT]
@Soon he led an
attack on the human
world and conquered
the whole continent.>
[NEXT]
@The humans fought back,
but they were nothing
to Mediuth's power.>
[NEXT]
@Then a man named
Anri appeared with a
blade of light to oppose
Mediuth.>
[NEXT]
@After a fierce battle,
he finally defeated
Mediuth.>
[NEXT]
@That's right. As you
know, that young man was
Anri the First who
founded Aritia.>
[NEXT]
@However, 100 years
after that dark age_>

Mediuth of Durhua has
awakened once more.>
